\section{The essentially algebraic theory of $E$-systems}

In this section we define what an $E$-system is in terms of sets and operations
and equations.

\begin{defn}
An extension algebra consists of a 
\begin{itemize}
\item A set $C$
\item A set $F$
\item A set $T$
\item A function $c:F\to C$
\item A function $t:T\to F$
\item A function $e_0:F\to C$
\item A function $e_1:c^{-1}(e_0(F))\to F$
\end{itemize}
such that the following equations hold:
\end{defn}
