# Internal models of type theory.

The goal of this project is to give a definition of internal models of type theory and their morphisms which has been set up in such a way that any choice of the type constructors can be left out if that is desired. The output of the project is a document containing all the ideas that go into the definition. Apart from the definition of internal models itself we also explore:

* examples of internal models together with their properties.
* variations to the syntax.
* properties of the class of all internal models and their morphisms.
* properties of other classes of internal models (e.g. those for which all morphisms are invertible).

The document `article-models-main.tex` is the main document. It compiles with `TeXlive 2012` or later versions thereof.
