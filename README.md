# In this project we investigate internal models of type theory. In the '90s,
# a definition of internal models has been given by Peter Dybjer. His definition
# relied, however, on the notion of a setoid and we wish to not be restricted
# in the level of homotopy complexity in any way. There are two main threads we
# may follow towards internal models: the first is an adaption of categories
# with families to type theory without identity types, the second is an
# internalization of the notion of a univalent typos which appears in the work
# of Andr√© Joyal and which has been explored by others before with some
# variations. 
# 
# In the second approach we need the ambient type theory to be univalent. In the
# first approach we need to adjust type theory to remove certain strictness in
# the compatibility of extension, weakening and substitution. However, this
# comes at the risk of destroying coherence properties as well. Exploring the
# situation is also part of the investigation.
