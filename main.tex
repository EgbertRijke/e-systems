\part{Type theory}

In this part we develop type theory from the ground up. We start with a type
theory without any of the basic constructors. This is the theory of contexts
families and terms which has the basic operations of extension, weakening,
substitution and identity terms. Type theory before type constructors has not
been studied very much. Dependent product types or even universes tend to make
an early appearance in just about any presentation of type theory.
A noteable exception is the theory of categories with families of Dybjer
in \cite{Dybjer1996}, which has been elaborated on further by Dybjer and
Clairambault in \cite{DybjerClairambault2011} and in unpublished work by
Awodey \cite{Awodey2013} on natural models of type theory,
which makes the connection between categories with families and representable
transformations of presheaves. In the way type theory is presented by the
Univalent Foundations Project in \cite{TheBook}, which seems to have won the race of introducing universes
as early as possible hands down, it seems entirely unfeasible to study type
theory without type constructors. Also, the 
proof-assistant \Coq\ {\color{red}(and \Agda too?)} has universes and dependent product and pair types 
built-in, making it impossible to study type theory without type constructors in 
that environment.

Nevertheless, type theory without type constructors has received some attention
contributors to the Univalent Foundations Program recently. We name two
further investigations on this topic, other than the mentioned work by Awodey.
In \cite{Garner2014}, Garner describes the combinatorial structure
of the type operations of the weakening, substitution and projection monads
(their projections are our identity terms) and suggests lots of further research
that can be done on type theory without constructors. Also, Joyal has presented
his theory of tribes, which is a categorical explanation of type theory
without type constructors.

After we have described the E-system, which is the flavor of type theory without
type constructors presented in \autoref{tt}, we will demonstrate in \autoref{ttderived}
that the theory gives rise to a rich categorical structure. The notions and
properties we derive here will be essential for the further work on internal
models for E-systems, presented in \autoref{part:models}.
